~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text is a program demonstrating how to use OSLib and the Toolbox to
write a simple Wimp application. It mainly demonstrates and tests
ToolLib's text_plot facility.


Compiling
~~~~~~~~~
To compile you will need to have Julian Smith's Makatic installed.

The source code and 'build applications' are in the Builds directory.

There are two ways to compile the program (two "builds"): double-click
on !Debug to compile the debug version of the program; double-click
on !Release to compile the production version.

Note that debug information is sent to the file pipe:$.debug.



General notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text is a very simple application. It shows how to redraw a window
and how to use ToolLib's text_plot routines.
