Click (c) Paul Field/Andrew Ellis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click is a program demonstrating how to use OSLib and the Toolbox to
write a simple Wimp application. It also demonstrates how to handle errors
by using exceptions (in C).

The program has a single window in which shapes (only circles at the moment)
can be displayed. Circles are added by clicking with the mouse and the colour
of circles can be changed using the menu.


Compiling
~~~~~~~~~
To compile you will need to have Julian Smith's Makatic installed.

The source code and 'build applications' are in the Builds directory.

There are two ways to compile the program (two "builds"): double-click
on !Debug to compile the debug version of the program; double-click
on !Release to compile the production version.

Note that debug information is sent to the file pipe:$.debug.



General notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click is a very simple application that demonstrates a "single document"
application. It shows how to redraw a window and demonstrates the idea
of using a data structure to store the contents of the window rather
than simply plotting directly to screen (as you would do in a non-Wimp program).
