!Tree Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0) Setting up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Load the program and click on the tree which should appear on the icon bar.

Fill in these values to the tree parameter window:

Segments:            1
Segment length:      10
Branch scale:        1.00
Branch scale scale:  1.00
Left branch offset:  0.50
Right branch offset: 0.50
Branch angle:        40
Angle scale:         1.00
Depth:               2

Click on "Draw tree" and a window should open with a very simple tree in it.


We can now explore what the various parameters do:

1) Segments
~~~~~~~~~~~
Change the segments value to 2 and then 3 (clicking on "Draw tree" each
time).

You can see that a segment is a 'trunk' with two branches sticking out and
that a tree (and also each branch) is made by stacking a number of segments
together.

Leave segments set to 3 for the remaining sections.


2) Segment length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Try altering the segment length parameter and clicking on "Draw Tree". You'll
see that this simply controls the length of the 'trunk' in the tree. You can
use it to alter the overall size of the tree.

Set segment length to 10 for the remaining sections.


3) Branch scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set branch scale to 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1.
You'll see that this parameter scales the branches of the tree. So if the
segment length is 10mm and the branch scale is 0.5 then the segments in the
branches will each be 5mm long.

If branch scale is greater than 1.00 then the branches will be longer than
the main trunk. Try 1.5 to see what I mean.

Set branch scale to 1.00 for the remaining sections.


4) Branch scale scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, this parameter has an extremely un-intuitive name.

Try setting it to 0.8, 0.5 and 1.5.

You'll see that this parameter changes the way branches in different segments
are scaled so, for example, your tree can be made to 'taper' towards the top.

The reason the parameter is called 'branch scale scale' is because it scales
the 'branch scale' parameter as you progress along segments. For example, if
branch scale is 1.0 and branch scale scale is 0.8 then the lowest set of
branches will be the same length as the trunk, the nest set will be 0.8 times
the length and the third set will be 0.64 (0.8 squared) times the length.

Set branch scale scale to 1.00 for the remaining sections.


5) Left and right branch offsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try altering left branch offset to 0, 0.25 and 1.

You'll see that these two parameters allow you to alter the position of the
branches within a segment (e.g. should they be at the top or the bottom of
the segment) and also to make the tree asymmetrical (by having different
values for left and right offsets).

Values near 0 seems to give bush-like trees wheras values near 1 give more
traditional-looking trees.

Set these parameters back to 0.5 for the remaining sections.


6) Branch angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try altering this to 10, 80 and 110

Fairly obviously, this changes the angle at which the branches sprout from
the trunk.

Set this to 40 for the remaining sections.


7) Depth (yes, I know I've skipped Angle scale)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change segments to 1 and then try depths of 3,4,5 and 6.

You'll see that depth changes the number of branches that you must
travel along to get from the trunk to a leaf.

A word of warning: If you have a large depth then the number of segments
should be small and vice-versa. If they are both 'large' together the tree
will be extremely complex and will either take a very long time to generate
and draw or else the program will run out of memory and generate an error.

Set depth to 6 for the last section.


8) Angle scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try changing this to 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3

You'll see that the angle scale alters the angle of the branches as you
proceed towards the leafs. Taking 0.5 as an example, the branches from the
main trunk come out at 40 degrees (the value of branch angle). The next level
of branches come from their branches at an angle of 0.5*40 = 20 degrees. The
next level at 0.5*20 = 10 degrees and so on. This lets you get a basic tree
shape but with whispy branches and plenty of space within the tree.


9) An example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's an example tree:

Segments:            2
Segment length:      12
Branch scale:        1.00
Branch scale scale:  0.80
Left branch offset:  0.5
Right branch offset: 0.5
Branch angle:        30
Angle scale:         0.94
Depth:               6


Try changing these parameters:
Left branch offset:  0.8
Right branch offset: 0.25


10) Things I might add
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I can possibly add other parameters if necessary. One possibility is a
parameter that shrinks the segment size along a branch (the branches can be
shrunk from segment to segment using branch scale scale but the segments
themselves are all the same length). Another possibility is to allow different
branch angle, branch scale etc. on the left and right.
Also I haven't done anything much about colour yet.

I could add facilities for loading and saving the parameters.

I could add a facility for automatically scaling the tree to be a particular
size but you can use segment length to do this manually.
