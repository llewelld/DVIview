  * Creates a 'saver' which responds to 'save' actions from the saveas object by setting
  * up an appropriate save buffer and calling perform_save.
  * perform_save should call save_buffer_send...() routines to send its data. It may
  * throw exceptions which will cause the save to be aborted and the exception to be rethrown
  * (so you can catch them in your main event loop)
  * Note that the hourglass is activated before perform_save is called (and turned off afterwards).
  *
  * In debugging mode, this checks that the object is a save as object but
  * it can't check that type 3 saving is expected.
