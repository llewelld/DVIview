 /* If stderr is attached to a RISC OS file and the environmental
  * variable <ToolLib$Flush> is defined, this call
  * forces all bytes to be written to the file.
  *
  * This call relies on the internal format of Acorn's FILE
  * implementation, which could change between releases of the compiler
  * and is unlikely to be the same from compiler to compiler.
  * The purpose of the call is to force data to be written to disc so that
  * if a machine-reset is necessary, debug data is not lost.
