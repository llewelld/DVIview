ToolLib utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are a few handy utilities for programming with ToolLib.

The first three are useful if you redirect stderr to pipe:$.debug
(as all the example programs do):

ClearDbg    - Removes the debug file

InterctDbg  - Displays the debug file in a TaskWindow (so you can see stderr
              output as the program generates it)
              
LoadDbg     - Loads the debug file into your favorite text editor.
              Use this when your program has exited - it is a lot faster
              than InterctDbg so use it if you don't mind waiting
              until your program has finished for debug output.


The other two are for Risc PC developers. You should check that your
program's user interface looks OK with the System font and with
Homerton.Medium. These two utilities simply select one of these fonts:

NormalFont - Choose Homerton.Medium as the system font

SystemFont - Choose System as the system font
