If you are upgrading from V0.92 or earlier you need the new !TeXFonts
application. If you don't have it (and !DVIview will complain) either contact
your supplier or the author (address given below).

Please note that although !DVIview is copyright Paul Field and an extremely
large amount of time and effort has gone into its development, it is completely
free and you may distribute it as you please (subject to a few conditions,
which are given in !DVIview.Doc.Docs).

If you find any problems with !DVIview or there's something you wish it did
(within reason :-) ) let me know and I will try to sort things out.
